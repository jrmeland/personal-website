# Inspiration

Simple list of who and what inspires me to do better, or at the very least, more.

## Linus

When I first read this guy's stuff, I just assumed it was _the_ Linus because of the amount of work and how impressive it is. He's the
first entry here because he was the straw that broke the camels back for me creating this site. 

Check out his website for some great stuff: <https://obsidian.md/>
